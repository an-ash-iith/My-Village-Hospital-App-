# My-Village-Hospital-App-
In Progress
I am developing a comprehensive website dedicated to my village to address health issues caused by the lack of hospitals and infrastructure. Many doctors volunteer their time for free services, and this app will facilitate communication between them and the villagers. It will help resolve minor health issues and provide proper guidance from doctors. Additionally, the app will notify villagers about doctor availability at the nearest government hospital and use live location to find nearby doctors. Most of the frontend and some backend work are complete, and I aim to finish by the end of July.
